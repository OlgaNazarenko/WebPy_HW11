## WebPy_HW11
REST API for storing and managing contacts [^1].


Run the following command to start the FastAPI server with uvicorn:

    uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload


[^1]: It was done with SQLite instead of PostgreSQL due to the system issues. 
    I was not able to add/install psycopg2.
